      <h3 id="welcome-to-my-first-blog.">Welcome to my first blog.</h3>
      <p>My name is Devin King, and I’m a cybersecurity analyst working
      in the maritime industry. My responsibilities span corporate
      infrastructure and vessel systems, where operational continuity,
      safety, and compliance intersect with rapidly evolving
      technology.</p>
      <p>In recent years, the maritime landscape has shifted
      dramatically. Connectivity and bandwidth on the water has improved
      exponentially through Starlink, cellular networks, and hybrid-WAN
      (Wide Area Network) solutions. These advancements enable real-time
      monitoring, data analytics, remote diagnostics, and centralized
      management capabilities that were previously out of reach.</p>
      <h3 id="but-this-growth-brings-complexity.">But this growth brings
      complexity.</h3>
      <p>From what I’ve seen, the industry is still working to meet
      baseline security standards. Meanwhile, vessels are evolving
      faster than traditional IT environments, introducing complexity at
      a pace IT teams are struggling to match.</p>
      <p>As connectivity increases, so does the volume of onboard
      technology. Many are deploying more systems to meet operational
      demands, but most prioritize functionality over security.</p>
      <h3 id="on-the-it-side">On the IT side:</h3>
      <ul>
      <li>IP cameras and onboard NVRs</li>
      <li>Remote access appliances</li>
      <li>Wireless access points</li>
      <li>Network firewalls and switches</li>
      <li>Cloud-connected management platforms</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="on-the-ot-side-complexity-is-growing-just-as-fast">On the
      OT side, complexity is growing just as fast:</h3>
      <ul>
      <li>Engine telemetry and performance monitoring</li>
      <li>Water depth and speed monitoring</li>
      <li>Fuel tracking sensors</li>
      <li>Barge analytics and telemetry</li>
      <li>Wind speed and directional input systems</li>
      <li>Integrated navigation suites</li>
      <li>AIS, GPS, and radar linked to shared onboard LAN networks</li>
      </ul>
      <p>And this is just vendor-supplied equipment to vessels. Are
      maritime IT teams and MSP’s equipped to handle the network
      complexity required to secure these environments?</p>
      <h3 id="vessels-are-no-longer-isolated-systems.">Vessels are no
      longer isolated systems.</h3>
      <p>From an IT perspective, they now resemble remote sites: they
      host credentials, run production-critical services, high-level
      decision-making is based on local analytics, and require secure
      access. Yet unlike branch offices, vessels are vastly more
      difficult to reach, harder to standardize, and are subject to
      extreme environmental conditions.</p>
      <p>OT is expanding alongside IT, often faster than defenses can
      scale. The result is a widening gap between what’s installed and
      what’s secured.</p>
      <h3 id="why-this-matters">Why This Matters</h3>
      <p>Securing maritime systems isn’t just about compliance, it’s
      about protecting people, operations, and national infrastructure.
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Regulatory Pressure:</strong> The U.S. Coast Guard’s new
      cybersecurity rules are raising the baseline. Operators will soon
      be accountable for identifying and mitigating cyber risks under
      federal oversight.</li>
        <li><strong>Operational Downtime:</strong>
      Unsecured systems can lead to outages that delay voyages, disrupt
      logistics, and cost companies thousands per hour.</li>
        <li><strong>Threats to the Marine Transportation System
      (MTS):</strong> Vulnerable vessels and facilities put the broader
      MTS at risk—impacting supply chains, port operations, and national
      security.</li>
        <li><strong>Safety Risks:</strong> Systems involved in
      navigation, propulsion, or situational awareness, if compromised,
      can directly impact the safety of crew, cargo, and the vessel
      itself.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Exposure:</strong> Many vessels store or
      transmit employee data, operational logs, and proprietary
      configuration files. A breach can mean lost PII, compromised
      credentials, or leaked sensitive information.</li>
        <li><strong>Financial
      Impact:</strong> From direct loss due to downtime, to reputational
      damage and regulatory fines—unsecured systems have tangible
      cost.</p></li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Cybersecurity isn’t optional anymore.</strong> It’s now
      a core component of maritime resilience.</p>
      <p>This blog is my attempt to document the realities of maritime
      cybersecurity, not from theory, but from the field. I’ll be sharing
      observations, automation workflows, and lessons learned while
      working in one of the most operationally unique sectors in
      infrastructure.</p>
