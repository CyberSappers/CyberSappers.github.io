      <p>In maritime environments, people often hear “<em>IT/OT
      separation</em>” tossed around like a buzzword. But many outside
      of cybersecurity don’t fully grasp what it means or why it matters
      so much. This isn’t just a technical preference. It’s a
      foundational safety requirement.</p>

      <h3 id="understanding-the-difference">Understanding the
      Difference</h3>
      <ul>
      <li><p>IT (Information Technology) deals with email, internet,
      software, business systems — these are the digital tools used to
      manage operations and communication.</p></li>
      <li><p>OT (Operational Technology) controls the ship itself —
      navigation, propulsion, engine systems, safety equipment,
      sensors.</p></li>
      </ul>
      <p>They serve two very different purposes. One supports business.
      The other keeps the vessel operational and safe.</p>

      <h3 id="why-they-must-be-separated">Why They Must Be
      Separated</h3>
      <ol type="1">
      <li><p><strong>To Contain Risk</strong> If someone clicks a bad
      link in an email or plugs in a compromised USB on the IT side, it
      shouldn’t be able to affect navigation systems. Keeping these
      environments separate limits how far a problem can
      spread.</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>To Prioritize Safety</strong> Business systems can
      go offline without immediate danger. OT systems can’t. If a safety
      control fails or a navigation system is tampered with, the
      consequences can be physical and immediate. The separation ensures
      business-side problems don’t put lives at risk.</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>To Respect Different Needs</strong> IT changes
      often. OT changes slowly — often only during drydock or major
      service windows. They’re built with different priorities and
      update cycles. Putting them together creates unnecessary strain
      and potential instability.</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>To Protect Against Mistakes</strong> Most cyber
      incidents come from human error, such as phishing. The more
      overlap between these two worlds, the easier it is for someone to
      accidentally cause a problem they didn’t understand, or provide a
      clear entry point for attackers. Separation provides a safety
      buffer.</p></li>
      </ol>
      <hr />
      <h3 id="what-awareness-looks-like">What Awareness Looks Like</h3>
      <ul>
      <li><p>Recognize that networks on a vessel are very different.
      Some networks run business tools, others steer the ship or controls navigation.</p></li>
      <li><p>Understand that convenience often comes at a cost. Easy
      file sharing or internet access from bridged systems can introduce
      unseen risks.</p></li>
      <li><p>Support clear policies that restrict cross-connections
      unless absolutely necessary, and only with proper
      oversight.</p></li>
      <li><p>Ask questions when new systems are added: Does this touch
      OT? Is there separation?</p></li>
      </ul>
      <hr />
      <h3 id="how-its-done">How It’s Done</h3>
      <p>Even without diving deep into technical diagrams, there are a
      few foundational principles that support proper IT/OT
      separation:</p>
      <ul>
      <li><p><strong>Network Segmentation</strong> Use VLANs or
      physically separate networks to isolate IT systems from OT
      systems. This isn’t just about labeling - it requires enforcement
      through firewalls or access control policies that prevent direct
      communication except for approved, logged pathways.</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Data Aggregation Points</strong> Instead of pulling
      data directly from an OT device, route information through a
      central, read-only collection point. This limits exposure and
      ensures all data flows can be monitored and controlled.</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Controlled Interfaces</strong> Any system that must
      connect both worlds (e.g., for monitoring or convenience) should be tightly
      managed. Use hardened jump boxes or gateways with strict access
      rules and full logging.</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Logging and Alerting</strong> Monitor all access to
      OT networks. Alerts should be configured for unexpected traffic
      patterns, failed login attempts, or system changes. Visibility is
      critical - you can’t defend what you can’t see.</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>No Direct Internet on OT Systems</strong>
      Operational systems should never have unfiltered internet access.
      This removes the primary threat vector for most attacks.</p></li>
      </ul>
      <p>The goal isn’t complexity, it’s control. Establish boundaries
      early, and enforce them consistently.</p>
      <hr />
      <h3 id="final-thought">Final Thought</h3>
      <p>This isn’t just a cybersecurity issue. It’s a <strong>safety
      and operational</strong> continuity issue. Keeping IT and OT
      separate isn’t paranoia - it’s discipline. And everyone on board,
      from leadership to crew, needs to understand the difference.</p>
